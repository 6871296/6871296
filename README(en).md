# Hello! I'm 6871296

welcome to visit my GitHub.

## Recommended repos
1. [CalculatorMax](https://github.com/6871296/calculatorMax.git)

CalculatorMax is my proudest repo, not one of them.(Maybe without DataIO) you can use all functions in `math` and `random` to calculate any complicated formulas. This is also the only project that can automatically install, semi-automatically uninstall external modules.

2. [DataIO](https://github.com/6871296/DataIO.git)

DataIO is my favorest repo, also not one of them. you can use a variety of functions (which is all typed by hands without `hash` needed `hashlib`, no depention, no generaion, no copy) to edit your JSON files easily. This'll also add automatically install, semi-automatically uninstall external modules in the newer versions.

## Commit rules

1. Welcome to **find bugs and remove them**.
2. **If you want to add some new functions, please let me know first.** Say what codes you'll add and where you'll add it, and why you want to add it.
3. If you want to delete codes or files, start a **pull request, not commit**.
4. **Check if there're bugs in your codes** before commit carefully. Don't upload codes that have bugs that can let the code can't correctly run.
5. **NEVER BREAK THESE RULES** if you want to commit and clone my codes.
